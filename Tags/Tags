Tags are useful to execute / skip requires tasks from number of tasks.

 to run required task with tags we have to use --tags tagname while running ansible playbook
or we can use -t also
we can just skip our any of the task
we have to use --skip-tags

we can also give one tag to two task.

We can list our available tags with
# ansible-playbook playbook_name --list-tags


# NOTE:- there is  tag called      never   whic is used to skip the task


if never tag is there we can execute the task by defining explicitly -t tag_name

# NOTE:- There is a tag called   always which is used to execute a task every time wheather we call it or not

when we execute --list-tags those tags with never and never itself do not displayed
