> Handlers are just like regular tasks in ansible playbook
> used when if we want to execute second task only if the first task is changed
> for handlers we need to use handlers section
> handlers section do not execute by it self we need to call it
> to call the handlers we have to se notify in task section
> Example :-
                notify:
                - start httpd
           handlers:
            - name: start httpd
              service:
              name: httpd
               state: started
