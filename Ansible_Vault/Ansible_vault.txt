> Ansible Vault is useful to encrypt your playbooks(including roles and variables).

Why we need to encrypt playbook?

We know that: Ansible is being used for automation, there is a possiblity that playbooks contain certain credentials,
SSl certificates or other sensitive data. Saving such sensitive data as aplain text is bad idea, because one wrong commit
to GitHub or laptop theft can cause an organization a huge loss.

> So, we need a way to store secrets securely
> Ansible Vault is the answer to this. Ansible  Vault can encrypt anything inside a YAML file, using a password of your choice

To encrypt a playbook
* ansible-vault encrypt launch_ec2_with_keys.yml
      > set password
      > confirm password

To run a encrypted playbook
  > we have to provide the password while running the playbook with help of --ask-vault-pass 
  * ansible-playbook launch_ec2_with_keys.yml --ask-vault-pass


To decrypt the playbook
     > we have option decrypt 
 * ansible-vault decrypt launch_ec2_with_keys.yml 
      > provide password 

Any file can be encrypted which contains variables


We can also create a playbbok that is in encrypted format
   > ansible-vault create encrypted.yml
   > Give password
   > write the playbook
   > save it


See the data of encrypted playbook
  > ansible-vault view encrypted.yml 
  > provide password

Edit the encrypted playbook 
> ansible-vault edit encrypted.yml


Change the Ansible vault password
    > ansible-vault rekey encrypted.yml
    > provide old password
    > provide new password
    > confirm new password
