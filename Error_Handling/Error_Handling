                            Error Handling

> Ansible normally has defaults that make sure to check the return codes of command/modules and it fails if return code is non-zero
> If the current task fails then playbook will stop the executing remaining tasks on the host.
> so for this situation we have to ignore errors

USE OPTION :- ignore_errors: yes

# We can wantedly fail a task even if it is not going to fail.

USE OPTION :- failed_when 
example:- 
- command: "ls /homee" 
       register: home_out
       failed_when: home_out.rc==0

# We can wantedly fail a task with some message also
