            How to read and print a variable value

so to read the variable value from command line while running the playbook 
we have to use 
vars_prompt      section
 name: x
 prompt: message to display while taking variable value

# Note :- while providing the value you will not see the value you are typing on command line. because it is private

So if you want to see the data you are typing then use

private: no
